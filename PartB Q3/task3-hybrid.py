Task 3: Hybrid encryption (AES + RSA) to securely send task2.txt

LECTORIAL CODE REFERENCES
Lectorial 8 - hybrid_crypto.py
    This example does hybrid encryption on a string, we used it as the base 
    for our code. What we used from it:
      - the structure and function names: generate_rsa_keys(),
        encrypt_message() and decrypt_message()
      - rsa.generate_private_key() with public_exponent=65537 and
        key_size=2048 to create the RSA key pair
      - os.urandom(32) for random AES-256 key and os.urandom(16) for the IV
      - Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CFB(iv)) with the encryptor and
        decryptor to encrypt and decrypt the data
      - encrypting the AES key with the public key using RSA OAEP padding
        (MGF1 with SHA256), decrypting it with the private key
      - b64encode to print the keys and encrypted values to the user
    What we changed:
      - it now encrypts and decrypts a file (task2.txt) instead of a string
      - the RSA keys are saved to separate .pem files and loaded back from
        them, and the decrypted data is saved to its own file
      - the encrypted file and the encrypted AES key are saved to files
      - all file paths use the BASE variable
      - the RSA public and private keys and the AES key are also displayed

Lectorial 5 - aes_cfb_file.py
    What we used from it:
      - it showed that AES in CFB mode needs no padding
      - reading and writing files as bytes ("rb" and "wb")
      - storing the IV at the start of the encrypted file and reading the
        first 16 bytes back as the IV when decrypting
      - the BASE = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) line

Lectorial 5 - rsa_padding_file.py
    Used as a second reference for the RSA OAEP padding block and for
    reading and writing the files with BASE.

So AES encrypts the file and RSA encrypts the AES key.
1. the code generates the RSA keys saved in the keys folder
2. we encrypt the file with a random AES key, then encrypt that AES
    key with the RSA public key
3. decrypts the AES key with their RSA private key, then decrypts the file with the AES key
